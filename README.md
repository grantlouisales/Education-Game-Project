This game is meant to teach younger children spelling while having fun playing a game. This game is like your typical Super Mario platformer game with a twist. The user will be controlling a player that can move left, right, and up when jumping. The user will coordinate their way around the map to collect letters. These letters will spell out a word that is given to the user to spell when the game starts. The user will control the player to jump around the map to collect letters. Once the player collects all the letters to spell the word, they will get a congratulations screen.

## Purpose
